# build/AUDIT.md — `v-audit` (PLAN.md §6)

Every package/feature decision below is backed by evidence read from the real
`vendor/src/anylinuxfs` submodule at commit `8aa9ccd6504e64ca26ce769c1623ed1741c6b7d3`
(`ANYLINUXFS_COMMIT` in `build/sources.lock`) — never guessed. File:line citations are given
for every non-obvious call. Scope test: {ntfs-3g mount, rpc.nfsd export, blkid device
detection} per PLAN.md §6 `v-audit`.

## anylinuxfs update-policy dry-run (2026-08-08)

The repeatable workflow is documented in
`docs/dev/ANYLINUXFS_UPDATE_POLICY.md` and enforced by
`build/audit-anylinuxfs-update.sh`. The preflight is deliberately read-only: it requires a clean
submodule at `ANYLINUXFS_COMMIT`, accepts only an explicitly fetched descendant from the exact
`nohajc/anylinuxfs` remote, reports the commit/file delta, and tests ntfsmac's source
transformations against a disposable archive. A pass leaves the decision pending; it cannot
change the submodule or `sources.lock`.

Dry-run evidence for upstream `v0.19.0`:

- Candidate `28d308bb9ed15611118fa51d998b988b3ee62459` is four commits after the current
  `8aa9ccd6504e64ca26ce769c1623ed1741c6b7d3` pin. The current pin itself is already 26
  commits after upstream `v0.18.0`, so the v0.19.0 release notes describe more behavior than the
  actual ntfsmac pin-to-candidate delta.
- The official `anylinuxfs-0.19.0` release was published 2026-07-20. The remaining four commits
  bump package versions to `0.19.0`, update `serde_with`, update Go `x/crypto` and its related
  `x/*` modules, and refresh twelve Cargo/Go manifest or lock files.
- The exact four-commit delta changes no Rust/Go implementation source, Alpine package manifest,
  dependency-download script, mount/NFS/vmnet path, or local patch marker. Both immutable-Alpine
  transformations apply successfully to the candidate archive.
- This is **not an accepted pin change**. Dependency-advisory review, candidate build/package
  gates, and real-hardware validation remain outstanding, so `sources.lock` and the submodule stay
  on the audited `0.18.0`/`8aa9ccd` state.

## Runtime Alpine pin and cache migration (P0.1, 2026-08-05)

- `ALPINE_TAG`, the linux/arm64 `ALPINE_DIGEST`, and `ANYLINUXFS_COMMIT` remain the only inputs.
  `cli/lib/runtime-alpine.sh` derives one immutable `docker.io/library/alpine@<digest>` pull
  reference, a tag-aware versioned cache directory, and a rootfs marker from them. The tag is kept
  separately because containers/image rejects Docker references that combine a tag and digest.
- The pinned anylinuxfs submodule is not edited. `build/lib/patch-runtime-alpine.sh` transforms only
  scratch build copies of Rust/config/Go sources and hard-stops if the audited markers drift.
- The init-rootfs patch preserves the full digest reference for the registry pull while using a
  deterministic digest-derived local OCI tag. `build/init-rootfs.sh` still independently checks
  Docker Hub's arm64 manifest digest before building or pulling.
- Runtime caches migrate side-by-side. Legacy, mismatched, invalid, and interrupted directories are
  retained; no install, Diagnose, or Settings action downloads or removes a rootfs. A mount either
  reuses a complete matching cache or initializes the pinned cache after preserving incompatible
  state.
- `build/verify-runtime-alpine.sh` inspects both shipped binaries and the exact staged package tree.
  Packaging fails before hashing/signing if a floating reference survives or the approved
  reference, versioned base directory, or marker is absent.

## ext2/3/4 mount support (added 2026-08-01) — no package, no vendored source

Scope expansion from NTFS-only to NTFS + ext2/3/4. Recorded here because it is a feature
decision, not because it changed the package list — it didn't.

- **No Alpine package added.** ext mount is kernel-side: the guest's `mount` invokes the
  built-in ext4 driver directly. No `e2fsprogs`/`xfsprogs`/`btrfs-progs`-style userspace tool
  is needed for mount (those are repair/resize tools, not mount deps — same reasoning the
  `btrfs-progs`/`zfs` CUT rows above use). The trimmed package list is unchanged.
- **No vendored source added (L9 unaffected).** The ext4 driver ships built into the
  vendored libkrunfw kernel image, not as a fetched artifact.
- **Kernel-module verification (real, not assumed):** `modules.squashfs`
  (`LIBKRUNFW_IMAGES_ASSET`, sha256 in `sources.lock`) was inspected with `unsquashfs`.
  `modules.builtin` inside it lists `kernel/fs/ext4/ext4.ko`, `kernel/fs/jbd2/jbd2.ko`, and
  `kernel/fs/mbcache.ko` as **built-in** — the ext4 driver (which mounts ext2/3/4) is in the
  kernel `Image`, not a loadable module. Gate passed; no new libkrunfw build needed.
- **No XPC/signing change (§0.3 unaffected).** ext uses blkid auto-detect + kernel mount —
  no `--fs-driver`, no passphrase, no helper/bundle-id touch. L1 (ntfs-3g default) is
  untouched: `--fs-driver` remains an NTFS-only option.
- **Wiring:** `cli/lib/list-drives.sh` and `gui/Drives/DriveScanner.swift` switched from
  `anylinuxfs list --microsoft` to bare `anylinuxfs list` + a client-side allow-set
  `{ntfs, exfat, BitLocker, ext2, ext3, ext4}` (mirrors `WINDOWS_FS_TYPES` + ext). Out-of-
  scope Linux FS (btrfs/xfs/zfs/LUKS/LVM) returned by bare `list` are dropped client-side.
  Note: the kernel image also has `xfs.ko`/`btrfs.ko`/`f2fs.ko`/`ntfs3.ko` built-in and
  `zfs.ko`/`spl.ko` loadable, but those are deliberately NOT wired into the allow-set — ext
  is the approved scope.

## Alpine packages — `init-rootfs/default-alpine-packages.txt` (13 packages)

| Package | Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `bash` | **KEEP** | `anylinuxfs/src/vm_image.rs:34` — `root_path.join("bin/bash")` is one of the files checked for rootfs validity (`required_files_exist`). Guest commands are run via `/bin/bash -c <cmd>` (`anylinuxfs/src/main.rs:731`). Hard requirement, not optional. |
| `blkid` | **KEEP** (settled, L-rule) | Disk identification — required by PLAN.md itself ("blkid-based device detection"). Also a shared-lib dependency (`libblkid.so.1`) of `lsblk`, `mount`, `nfs-utils`, `ntfs-3g-progs` per the real Alpine v3.23 aarch64 APKINDEX. |
| `btrfs-progs` | **CUT** | No source reference anywhere in `anylinuxfs`/`vmproxy`/`init-rootfs` beyond its own package-list entry. Not a transitive dependency of any kept package (APKINDEX: depends only on shared libs, all already satisfied elsewhere or unused once cut). BTRFS is a filesystem type ntfsmac doesn't support. |
| `cryptsetup` | **KEEP — reversed 2026-07-10** | Used for LUKS/BitLocker volume decryption: `vmproxy/src/main.rs:714` ("Decrypt LUKS/BitLocker volumes using cryptsetup"), `:752` (`Command::new("/sbin/cryptsetup")`). Originally cut (PLAN.md's XPC surface doesn't yet expose a passphrase param), but the maintainer wants encrypted-NTFS/BitLocker mount support preserved rather than silently dropped — feature cuts should not trade away user-facing capability. Kept in the trimmed list; wiring the passphrase param through the XPC surface is a Phase 2/3 task, not this audit's. |
| `lsblk` | **KEEP** | `anylinuxfs/src/diskutil/mod.rs:1146` runs `/bin/lsblk -O --json` inside the guest as the core of `get_lsblk_info`, used by both disk listing and mount device resolution. Confirmed hard dependency, not guessable from the package name alone. |
| `lvm2` | **KEEP** — corrected 2026-07-12, see below | Originally cut on the strength of one call site (`vgchange -ay`, confirmed harmless). Missed a second: `vmproxy/src/main.rs:1106-1120` — guest-side `vmproxy`'s own boot sequence unconditionally runs `mount_tmpfs()` over a fixed dir list including `/etc/lvm/archive` and `/etc/lvm/backup`, and `mount_tmpfs()` (`main.rs:633-640`) hard-`bail!`s on the first dir that doesn't exist. Those two dirs only exist because lvm2's Alpine postinstall script creates them — cutting the package removed the dirs, which crashed `vmproxy` on **every** VM boot (`Failed to mount tmpfs on /etc/lvm/archive` → guest exits 1 → host sees "libkrun VM exited with status: 1" → NFS server never comes up → mount fails). Confirmed against a real failing mount log, not assumed. Restored to keep the guest's fixed init-mount list intact; this is the sanctioned patch channel (swap the package list, never hand-edit the vendored submodule) already used for every other trim in this table. |
| `mdadm` | **CUT** | `anylinuxfs/src/diskutil/mod.rs:1150-1153` — `/sbin/mdadm --assemble --scan` only runs `if assemble_raid` (an explicit opt-in CLI flag for RAID arrays). ntfsmac's scope never sets this flag (no RAID support planned). Safe cut — the code path is never reached. |
| `mount` | **KEEP** | Used extensively and unconditionally: `/bin/mount` direct invocation (`vmproxy/src/main.rs:974`), `mount -t nfs -o ...` (`anylinuxfs/src/cmd_mount.rs:1056`, `anylinuxfs/src/fsutil.rs:322`), `mount -t tmpfs` for `/tmp`/`/run` setup in every guest script (`diskutil/mod.rs:1143-1144`, `main.rs:680`). Core requirement. |
| `nfs-utils` | **KEEP** (settled, L-rule) | Provides `rpc.nfsd`, explicitly required for the NFS export step of the mount flow (PLAN.md §2.2 step 5). Real APKINDEX shows it transitively pulls `rpcbind` and `python3` — both resolved automatically by `apk add nfs-utils`, no manual addition needed to the trimmed list. |
| `ntfs-3g` | **KEEP** (settled, L-rule) | Default driver (L1). Provides `mount.ntfs-3g`, `mount.ntfs`, `lowntfs-3g` — the actual FUSE mount binaries invoked for the default driver path. |
| `ntfs-3g-progs` | **CUT** | Provides `ntfsfix`, `ntfsresize`, `mkntfs`, `ntfslabel`, etc. Grepped the entire Rust source tree (`anylinuxfs/src`, `vmproxy/src`, `common-utils/src`) for every one of these tool names — **zero references**. Not invoked anywhere in the mount/unmount/diagnose flow. Dirty-volume detection (Phase 3 `3-dirty-ro-warning`) is handled by the FUSE driver itself at mount time (ntfs-3g's own dirty-bit check → automatic RO fallback), not by shelling out to `ntfsfix`. Can be re-added later if a repair feature is ever built — nothing in current PLAN.md scope calls for it. |
| `squashfs-tools` | **KEEP** — caught by audit, not assumption | Initially looked like a cut candidate (squashfs mounting is a kernel driver capability, not a userspace-tool need). Real evidence overturned that: `init-rootfs/main.go:345` embeds `unsquashfs -mem 32M -d $MOD_PATH modules.squashfs` into the **guest's own first-boot `vm-setup.sh`** (written via `writeSetupScript`, `main.go:325-350`), which unpacks the kernel-modules squashfs archive into `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)` at guest first boot. `unsquashfs` (from `squashfs-tools`) must be present in the guest image for this step to succeed. This is exactly the kind of transitive requirement PLAN.md warns not to cut on name alone. |
| `zfs` | **CUT** | No source reference beyond its own package-list line. ZFS is a filesystem type ntfsmac doesn't support. Its Alpine package deps (`libzfs`, `libnvpair`, etc.) are exclusive to it — nothing else in the trimmed set needs them. |

**Net result: 13 → 9 packages.** `bash blkid cryptsetup lsblk lvm2 mount nfs-utils ntfs-3g squashfs-tools`
written to `build/alpine-packages.trimmed.txt`.

## Cargo feature flags (real, read from the actual `Cargo.toml` files)

- `anylinuxfs/Cargo.toml`, `vmproxy/Cargo.toml`, `vmrunner-sys/Cargo.toml` — all three declare
  `default = ["freebsd"]` / `freebsd = []` (an empty marker feature; the actual `#[cfg(feature =
  "freebsd")]` gates live in the Rust source, e.g. `anylinuxfs/src/vm_image.rs:10`).
- Per PLAN.md's settled decision: **`-F freebsd` is marked test-drop.** Empirical
  "does it compile clean without the flag" verification is `v-anylinuxfs-build`'s job (tier
  `large`, has its own build+test step) — this audit only confirms the flag exists exactly as
  PLAN.md described and identifies where it's used, so that unit isn't guessing either.
- No other Cargo feature, dependency, or Alpine package beyond the settled cuts
  (`freebsd-bootstrap`, `vmproxy-bsd`, `-F freebsd`) is added or removed by this audit.

## Correction to CLAUDE.md's vendored-source table

`anylinuxfs/Cargo.toml` pins `libkrun = { version = "1.19.3", features = ["blk", "net"] }` — a
normal **crates.io** semver dependency, not a direct git dependency. `CLAUDE.md`'s table says
"Cargo.lock exact commit — not hand-edited," which assumes a git dependency; in reality the pin
that matters is the crates.io package version + Cargo.lock's checksum for that exact published
crate (still not hand-edited — same spirit, different mechanism). `build/sources.lock`'s
`LIBKRUN_COMMIT=SEE_CARGO_LOCK` entry still holds (Cargo.lock remains the source of truth), but
recorded here since it's a real discrepancy from the assumption in CLAUDE.md, not an invented
fact — flagged here for awareness, not blocking.

## `init-freebsd` / `gvproxy-darwin` — confirms settled cuts are real, not just theoretical

`vendor/src/anylinuxfs/download-dependencies.sh` (upstream's own fetch script) does fetch
`init-freebsd` from `nohajc/libkrun` releases and a prebuilt `gvproxy-darwin` binary on macOS
hosts. This confirms the settled PLAN.md cuts are meaningful (upstream's default build includes
both) — ntfsmac's `v-fetch-prebuilt` must **not** replicate the `init-freebsd` fetch, and
`v-gvproxy` deliberately builds from source instead of using the prebuilt `gvproxy-darwin`
binary. Neither is a deviation from PLAN.md; both are the plan working as intended.

## `v-alpine-rootfs` build environment findings (2026-07-10)

Building `vmrunner-sys` (Rust, a `v-alpine-rootfs` dependency via the patched
`init-rootfs` Go tool) surfaced two real, repo-location-specific build bugs — not
upstream bugs, environment ones. Both are load-bearing for **any** future Cargo build
that pulls in `libkrun` from this repo (this will resurface in `v-anylinuxfs-build`,
which also depends on `libkrun` directly):

1. **Path-with-spaces breaks `krun-init-blob`'s build script.** When this repo lives
   on a path containing spaces (e.g. a network-mounted "Windows Shared Folder" volume),
   `krun-init-blob`'s `build.rs` (pulled in transitively via `libkrun`)
   whitespace-splits the resolved `CC_LINUX` compiler path (the common
   `CC="ccache gcc"`-style convention of treating the env var as
   compiler-plus-flags), so a space in the path truncates it:
   `failed to execute <repo>: No such file or directory` (truncated at the first
   space). Confirmed by building the identical vendored sources from a space-free
   path, which compiles clean.
   **Fix applied:** `build/init-rootfs.sh` builds the patched `vmrunner-sys`/`init-rootfs`
   copy from a space-free cache dir outside the repo (`$TMPDIR/ntfsmac-build/...`), not
   under `$REPO_ROOT/build/.cache/`. **Recommend `v-anylinuxfs-build` do the same** for
   building the `anylinuxfs` crate itself, to avoid re-discovering this.
2. **This repo's volume doesn't support the fsync/ioctl calls `go.podman.io/image`'s
   blob-copy step makes.** Real failure pulling the Alpine OCI image with output
   pointed at `vendor/rootfs/` (on this "Windows Shared Folder" network-mounted
   volume): `sync .../oci-put-blob...: inappropriate ioctl for device`. This is the
   same class of issue as an earlier `git add` failure on a large file in this
   volume (session history) — this volume doesn't fully support POSIX semantics some tools
   assume. Plain writes (curl downloads, tar extraction, `go build`/`cargo build`
   output — see `vendor/kernel/`, `vendor/bin/`) work fine; it's specifically this
   fsync pattern that doesn't. **Fix applied:** the real Alpine pull/unpack also
   happens in the space-free off-volume cache dir, not `vendor/rootfs/` directly.
   **This means `build/init-rootfs.sh` cannot literally satisfy PLAN.md's "output
   under `vendor/rootfs/`" wording on this volume** — flagged here; the script
   prints the real output path (`NTFSMAC_ROOTFS_HOME=...`) instead.
3. **New toolchain dependency: `lld`.** `cc_linux` (the vendored cross-compiler
   wrapper anylinuxfs already ships, used unmodified) invokes
   `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang -fuse-ld=lld`; Homebrew's `llvm` formula does not
   bundle the `lld` linker — it's a separate formula. Installed via
   `brew install lld` (build-toolchain tap, consistent with Phase V's "zero brew taps
   beyond build-toolchain ones" exit criterion). Not yet added to `build/preflight.sh`
   — should be, since a fresh machine will hit the exact same failure.
4. **Real, confirmed empirical result:** `vmrunner-sys` compiles clean **without**
   `-F freebsd` (once the above two issues are worked around) — consistent with
   PLAN.md's settled "-F freebsd is test-drop" decision, now verified for this crate
   specifically (previously only asserted, not built).
5. **Real DAG gap found:** the vendored `init-rootfs` tool's full flow (pull → unpack →
   generate `vm-setup.sh` → embed `vmproxy` binary + `modules.squashfs` into the
   rootfs → boot a VM to actually run `apk add`) tries to copy `vmproxy` from a
   `libexec/` dir — but `vmproxy` is a `v-anylinuxfs-build` artifact, which PLAN.md's
   DAG (§5) places **after** `v-alpine-rootfs` (V-1 → V-2), not before. So
   `v-alpine-rootfs`, as literally scoped, cannot reach the VM-boot / real-apk-install
   step on a first pass. **What `build/init-rootfs.sh` verifies for real:** Alpine
   pulled at the digest-verified pin, unpacked, and `vm-setup.sh` generated with
   **exactly** our trimmed package list (`apk --update --no-cache add bash blkid
   cryptsetup lsblk mount nfs-utils ntfs-3g squashfs-tools` — confirmed byte-for-byte
   via a real run). This satisfies `v-alpine-rootfs`'s literal acceptance wording (the
   package manifest). **What's deferred:** vmproxy embedding + actual VM boot +
   real `apk add` execution — re-run `build/init-rootfs.sh` after `v-anylinuxfs-build`
   lands (it stages `vendor/bin/vmproxy` automatically if present) to complete and
   verify that part; `modules.squashfs` staging (from `v-fetch-prebuilt`'s output) is
   already wired and confirmed working.

## Integration note for `v-alpine-rootfs` (next unit, not resolved here)

`init-rootfs/main.go` embeds `default-alpine-packages.txt` via `//go:embed` at Go compile time
(`main.go:293`) and generates a first-boot `apk add` script from it (`writeSetupScript`,
`main.go:325`). `build/alpine-packages.trimmed.txt` (this unit's output) is the trimmed
replacement list, but *how* it gets substituted — patching anylinuxfs's embedded file before
building `init-rootfs`'s Go binary, vs. `build/init-rootfs.sh` building the rootfs directly via
`umoci` + our own `apk add` step bypassing anylinuxfs's Go tool — is `v-alpine-rootfs`'s decision
to make, not this audit's.

## Host-side static libblkid — Homebrew static-archive staging (tosbaha #1 fix, 2026-08-01)

**Problem (real, from the issue tracker):** the macOS-host `anylinuxfs` binary dynamically
linked `/opt/homebrew/*/libblkid.1.dylib` because `libblkid-rs`/`libblkid-rs-sys` (Cargo dep
at `anylinuxfs/Cargo.toml:12`) resolves libblkid via pkg-config, and the submodule's
`anylinuxfs/.cargo/config.toml` hardcodes
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/util-linux/lib/pkgconfig`. On any machine without
`brew install util-linux`, the binary aborted at launch (`Library not loaded: libblkid.1.dylib`,
DYLD Namespace code 1) — broke both the CLI and the GUI (the GUI shells out to the same
`/usr/local/ntfsmac/bin/anylinuxfs`).

**Decision (maintainer):** static-link `libblkid` into `anylinuxfs` so the shipped binary has no
libblkid dylib in its `otool -L` output. **Use Homebrew's already-built static archives —
NOT a vanilla util-linux from-source build.** Homebrew's `util-linux` is the build known to
work on macOS (a vanilla tarball build is the risky path we deliberately do not take; an
earlier plan to build util-linux 2.40.4 from source with upstream PR #4173 was rejected on
this basis). `build-libblkid-static.sh` stages Homebrew's `libblkid.a` + `libuuid.a` (Homebrew
ships both) into a dylib-free stage dir, authors `blkid.pc`/`uuid.pc` pointing at it, and
`build-all.sh` points the anylinuxfs cargo build there. With only `.a` in the stage,
`-lblkid`/`-luuid` resolve to the static archives for certain. Rejected alternatives:
- **Document `brew install util-linux`** — violates the CLAUDE.md non-negotiable that
  `vendor/bin/anylinuxfs list` works with zero brew taps beyond build-toolchain ones at runtime.
- **Bundle a Homebrew util-linux dylib + rpath/sign fixes** — a prebuilt dylib plus
  per-target rpath/install_name wiring in `install.sh` and `package-app.sh`. Static is
  cleaner on the distribution side (nothing to bundle).

**Transitive deps (found by a real static-link proof, not guessed):** `libblkid.a` references
`_libintl_gettext` (GNU gettext — not in libSystem), so Homebrew `gettext`'s `libintl.a` is
staged too and `intl` is added to `blkid.pc`'s `Requires.private`. `libintl.a` in turn
references `_iconv`/`_iconv_open` (→ `libiconv.2.dylib`, a **system** lib in `/usr/lib`) and
`_CFArrayGetCount` (→ CoreFoundation, a **system** framework). `intl.pc` declares
`Libs.private: -liconv -framework CoreFoundation`. Net runtime deps added are all
OS-provided (libSystem, libiconv, CoreFoundation — present on every macOS); **no Homebrew
dylib is needed at runtime.** `libuuid` needs `-lpthread` (libSystem provides it), declared
in `uuid.pc`'s `Libs.private`. The proof: a tiny C program linked via
`pkg-config --static --libs blkid` builds clean, runs (`blkid_get_cache` succeeds), and
`otool -L` shows only the three system libs — no `libblkid`/`libuuid`/`libintl` dylib.

**Build dep (not a runtime dep):** `util-linux` and `gettext` are Homebrew **build-toolchain**
deps. `build/sources.lock` records `UTIL_LINUX_BREW_FORMULA=util-linux` (no tarball/sha256 —
we consume Homebrew's install, not a fetched artifact). `build/preflight.sh` asserts both
formulas are installed AND ship the static archives (`libblkid.a`/`libuuid.a`/`libintl.a`),
since the whole fix depends on the `.a` being present, not just the dylib.

**Wiring (`build/build-all.sh`):** `build-libblkid-static.sh` runs before
`build_anylinuxfs`; the latter exports `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<stage>/lib/pkgconfig` +
`PKG_CONFIG_ALL_STATIC=1` around `cargo build --release` (Cargo `[env]` default `force=false`
→ shell env wins over the submodule's homebrew path), AND neutralizes the homebrew
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH` line in the CACHE_DIR copy of `.cargo/config.toml` (belt-and-suspenders:
if the env override ever stopped winning, the build still couldn't fall back to the dylib).
The submodule itself is never edited — same rule as `patch_vmproxy_mount_tmpfs`. The stage
defaults to a **space-free** path under `$TMPDIR` (not the repo) for the same reason
`build-all.sh` copies anylinuxfs to a space-free `CACHE_DIR`: this repo's path-with-spaces
makes pkg-config backslash-escape the `-I`/`-L` paths, which the pkg-config Rust crate
mis-parses.

**Acceptance:** `tests/build/build-all.bats` asserts (1) the wiring is present (fast, grep)
and (2) `otool -L vendor/bin/anylinuxfs` has no `libblkid` entry (slow, real build).
`tests/build/util-linux.bats` runs the stager for real (it only copies Homebrew's `.a` +
headers + authors `.pc` — fast, no source build) and asserts the stage is dylib-free, the
`.pc` chain pulls `uuid`+`intl` statically, and `pkg-config --static --libs blkid` resolves
to the staged archives.
