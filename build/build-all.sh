# build/build-all.sh — v-anylinuxfs-build (PLAN.md §6). Phase V's main assembly unit.
#
# Orchestrates the other build scripts, then builds anylinuxfs (macOS host CLI) and
# vmproxy (Linux guest agent, aarch64-unknown-linux-musl) WITHOUT -F freebsd, per
# PLAN.md's settled decision. Builds from a space-free cache dir outside the repo —
# same fix as build/init-rootfs.sh: this repo's path-with-spaces breaks
# krun-init-blob's build script (a libkrun dependency, pulled in by anylinuxfs
# directly). Runs cargo test for common-utils/anylinuxfs/vmproxy (vmproxy tests run
# on the HOST target, not the musl cross target — matches anylinuxfs's own
# run-rust-tests.sh: unit tests verify shared logic, not Linux-specific syscalls).
#
# If the freebsd-dropped build does NOT compile clean, PLAN.md says: keep the flag,
# record why in AUDIT.md, and HARD-STOP — never drop it blind.

# patch_vmproxy_mount_tmpfs — real bug, reproduced on real hardware (not guessed):
# mount_tmpfs() in vmproxy/src/main.rs mounts tmpfs directly onto each path in
# tmpfs_dirs (which includes /etc/lvm/archive and /etc/lvm/backup) without ever
# creating the mount-point directory first. Alpine's lvm2 package does not ship
# those two subdirectories (lvm tools create them lazily on first use), so
# `mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /etc/lvm/archive` fails with "mount point does not exist",
# vmproxy bails, the guest VM exits 1, gvproxy tears down, and the host reports
# "NFS server not ready" / "anylinuxfs reported success but no NFS mount is
# present" — every mount attempt fails. Root-cause fix in the one shared function
# every tmpfs target already routes through (not a special case for lvm's two
# paths): mkdir -p the target before mounting. Patches the CACHE_DIR copy only —
# vendor/src/anylinuxfs (the submodule) is never edited, same rule init-rootfs.sh
# already follows for its packages-list swap. This is the single vmproxy binary
# both the CLI and the GUI (via the SMJobBless helper) invoke, so the fix covers

# PLAN.md §6's "-F freebsd is test-drop" decision, tested for real (not guessed) on
# every crate that has the flag:
#   - vmrunner-sys (no common_utils dep): compiles clean WITHOUT freebsd. Dropped —
#     see build/init-rootfs.sh, unaffected by this file.
#   - anylinuxfs: does NOT compile without it. Real errors —
#     Preferences::default_image()/images() and a mutable-borrow requirement are all
#     gated behind the feature and used unconditionally elsewhere. Per PLAN.md's own
#     pre-specified fallback for exactly this case: keep the flag, record why (done,
#     here and in AUDIT.md), don't force it off.
#   - vmproxy: its Cargo.toml doesn't set `default-features = false` on its
#     common_utils path dependency, so common_utils (which also defaults the flag on)
#     builds with freebsd enabled regardless of what flag vmproxy's own build uses —
#     forcing vmproxy's own flag off doesn't cleanly disable freebsd project-wide, it
#     just adds an inconsistency. Built WITH default features for consistency.
# None of this affects the REAL settled cuts, which stay cut regardless of this Cargo
# feature flag's on/off state: freebsd-bootstrap (Go tool) and vmproxy-bsd
# (aarch64-unknown-freebsd cross target) are never built; init-freebsd is never
# fetched. The feature flag only toggles some inactive (for our target) code paths
# compiling in, not any extra built artifact.
