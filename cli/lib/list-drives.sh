# interactive picker. Parses `anylinuxfs list` the same way the GUI's
# gui/Drives/DriveScanner.swift DriveListParser does (there is no --json flag on ListCmd,
# confirmed against vendor/.../anylinuxfs/src/cli.rs) — one shared regex shape, two
# implementations, kept in sync deliberately since bash and Swift can't share source.
#
# Scope: NTFS (ntfs/BitLocker) + ext2/3/4. exFAT is excluded — macOS reads/writes exFAT
# natively, so ntfsmac should not surface it. anylinuxfs list returns ALL Linux FS types
# (btrfs/xfs/zfs/LUKS/LVM/...), so we filter client-side to NTFSMAC_ALLOWED_FS_TYPES. Keep
# this array and DriveListParser's allowedFsTypes in sync (same comment in DriveScanner.swift).

# Filesystems ntfsmac mounts: NTFS + BitLocker + ext2/3/4 (kernel auto-detect, no --fs-driver).
# The real anylinuxfs TYPE column is NOT always a single blkid fstype token: for NTFS, blkid's
# fs_type can be empty, so darwin::augment_line falls back to the raw partition type name:
# "Microsoft Basic Data" on GPT and "Windows_NTFS" on MBR. The parser captures the whole
# TYPE+NAME blob and derives fstype from it — both prefixes are in the server's own
# WINDOWS_FS_TYPES set, so matching them client-side replicates --microsoft's reliability
# without a second anylinuxfs call. Note: "Microsoft Basic Data" is the GPT type
# for ntfs AND exfat; when blkid resolves exfat it surfaces as "exfat" and is dropped by the
# allow-set, but the rare GPT-fallback case can't distinguish the two (same limitation as the
# server's --microsoft filter). Keep this array and DriveListParser's allowedFsTypes in sync
