# ntfsmac GUI — Feature & Button Plan

> Custom SwiftUI menu-bar app (no Dock icon). Wraps the CLI + pf security layer via an XPC helper.
> Companion to `PLAN.md` Phase 3 — that covers engineering scaffolding; this covers what the user sees and taps.

## Design principles

- **One job, zero clutter.** Pick a drive, mount it, get out of the way.
- **Status at a glance.** Menu-bar icon colour tells the whole story without opening the popover.
- **Never lie about safety.** If a drive mounts read-only (dirty journal), say so loudly before the user trusts a write.

---

## App shape

Menu-bar agent → click icon → popover. Settings is a page inside that same popover; the only
separate system UI is the first-run helper authorization prompt.

### Menu-bar icon states

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| System-adaptive | Idle, nothing mounted |
| Blue (pulsing) | Mounting |
| Green | Mounted read/write |
| Yellow | Mounted **read-only** (dirty journal) |
| Red | Error |

The idle SF Symbol is an AppKit template image, so macOS supplies the same contrasting tint used
by native menu-bar apps. This keeps the icon visible across light and dark menu-bar backgrounds
without adding a preference or first-run animation. Saturated colours remain reserved for real
mounting, mounted, warning, and error states.

## Features

**v1 (MVP — ship with the GUI):**
1. Auto-detect compatible drives (polls `anylinuxfs list`).
2. One-click mount / unmount.
3. Live mount status + transfer speed.
4. Dirty-drive read-only detection + warning.
5. Security indicators (isolated network, VPN bypass, and PF status) with presentation-only Hide/Show.
6. Open mounted volume in Finder.
7. Diagnose (runs the CLI diagnostic, shows result).
8. First-run helper install (one auth prompt, via SMJobBless).

**v2 (later):**
- Launch at login toggle.
- Per-drive default mount options (ro/rw, mount point).
- Multi-drive mounts (gated on upstream vmnet-helper / concurrent-mount support).
- Notifications on mount/unmount/error.
- Eject-all.

## Button & control plan

### Popover — idle (no mount)

| Control | Action | Enabled when |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Drive row `[Mount]` | Mount that drive r/w via XPC helper | A compatible drive is detected |
| Refresh (↻) | Re-scan drives now | Always |
| `Diagnose` | Run CLI diagnostic, show summary | Always |
| ⚙ (gear) | Navigate to Settings in the popover | Always |
| `Quit` | Exit app, tear down network state | Always |

### Popover — mounted

| Control | Action | Enabled when |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| `Open in Finder` | Reveal mount point | Mounted |
| `Unmount` | Safe unmount + pf/route teardown | Mounted |
| Speed bar | Live throughput (read-only display) | Mounting / mounted |
| SECURITY `Hide` / `Show` | Collapse or restore only the measured security rows | Mounted |
| ⚙ / `Quit` | As above | Always |

### Mount-state truth contract

The GUI and CLI control one real host mount state. The macOS NFS mount table plus ntfsmac-owned
anylinuxfs session evidence are authoritative; `MountController.mountedDrives` is only a
presentation cache.

The app reconciles those sources on launch, popover open, every five seconds, Refresh, and after
helper completion. It discovers CLI-created mounts, removes externally unmounted rows, and verifies
the effective read-only/read-write state per mount point. If evidence is incomplete or disagrees,
the row keeps recovery controls but becomes warning/unknown; the header and icon must never stay
green. Concurrent rows are reconciled independently.

The live finding and acceptance matrix are recorded in
[`../audits/LIVE_MOUNT_STATE_AND_NFS_TRANSPORT_AUDIT_2026-08-06.md`](../audits/LIVE_MOUNT_STATE_AND_NFS_TRANSPORT_AUDIT_2026-08-06.md).

### Security transaction and external unmount contract

The lower-layer mount path owns a per-session PF child anchor, PF enable reference, and optional
exact VPN-bypass route. Those resources are applied before backend NFS readiness can complete and
are released only by their owning session. The GUI SECURITY rows remain `unknown` until the fixed
reason-coded transaction evidence is wired into them; Hide/Show is presentation-only.

App Unmount is the canonical owner-driven operation. Finder Disconnect removes only the synthetic
NFS client mount, after which reconciliation asks the helper to complete backend/PF/route cleanup.
Finder eject of the physical USB device is a distinct whole-device action: unmount in ntfsmac,
wait for the detected/unmounted state, then eject the hardware.

One packaged NTFS/VPN-on run passed GUI unmount, Finder Disconnect, external NFS unmount, private
route/transport checks, and payload read-back. VPN-off, CLI-created mount discovery, restart/crash,
physical eject/hot-unplug, and concurrent-device cells remain required. See
[`../audits/LIVE_P0_SECURITY_TRANSACTION_AUDIT_2026-08-11.md`](../audits/LIVE_P0_SECURITY_TRANSACTION_AUDIT_2026-08-11.md).

### Read-only (dirty) state — extra

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Warning banner | "Mounted read-only — drive has an unclean journal. Eject safely in Windows to enable writing." (non-dismissable while RO) |
| `Mount read/write anyway` | Re-mount r/w **only after** an explicit confirm dialog spelling out corruption risk |

### Error state

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Error message | Plain-language cause (helper not installed, binary missing, mount failed) |
| `Retry` | Re-attempt last action |
| `Diagnose` | Jump to diagnostics |
| `⌘`-click `Diagnose` | Save the same read-only diagnostic JSON for developer support |

### Diagnostic summary

Diagnostic rows distinguish confirmed health, expected or transitional information, actionable
warnings, and unavailable context. A stopped vmnet bridge is informational while ntfsmac is idle
or starting a mount; it becomes a warning only when a drive is already mounted and the private NFS
network is expected to be active. Unknown or malformed values are shown neutrally rather than as
confirmed failures. Short explanations remain available through native help and accessibility
text without widening the popover.

The GUI renders the same privacy-safe runtime contract as CLI text and JSON: expected and detected
host-runtime versions, audited source commits, the approved Alpine tag/digest, selected cache state,
and installed guest package versions. SECURITY Hide/Show changes presentation only; it never alters
mount, helper, or measured security state.

### Settings page

The gear replaces the main popover content with Settings. A keyboard-reachable `Back` action
returns to the previous application content. Normal, first-run, and CLI-repair screens all use the
same route and the same long-lived Settings/helper objects; navigation does not open an `NSWindow`
or recreate in-flight state. The title includes the app release/build directly underneath in
small secondary text; it is informative and never competes visually with the `Settings` heading.

| Control | Type | Default |
|---------|------|---------|
| Launch at login | Toggle | Off |
| Default mount mode | Segmented: Read-only / Read-write | Read-write |
| Default mount point | Path picker | `/Volumes/<label>` |
| Show speed in menu bar | Toggle | Off |
| Reinstall privileged helper | Button | — |

The destructive uninstall confirmation is rendered inside the Settings page so selecting it does
not dismiss the transient menu-bar popover before the operation starts. Cancel consumes no action;
confirm can start the flow only once, and the control remains disabled while removal is active or
after it completes. The helper XPC connection is created lazily on the first privileged request,
not merely because the app launched.

---

## Control → privilege boundary (non-negotiable)

Every control that mounts, unmounts, or touches pf/route goes through the **SMJobBless XPC helper** — never a raw `sudo` shell-out from the UI. Device names are validated against `^disk[0-9]+s[0-9]+$` in *both* the UI and the helper before any shell call. (Mirrors `PLAN.md` §4.2.)
